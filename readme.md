## flutter-builder

### Description
An image to build flutter apps APKs withotu installing all dependencies (Flutter SDK or SDK platform-tools). **This image is purely experimental as it seems to be resource-costly and unadapted if your environnement isn't powerful enough**.

### The image
The image installs Flutter SDK and SDK platform-tools on its own container and set the environnement variables up. It is based on Amazon Corretto 17.
